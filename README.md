# GPTAvatar Multiplayer Extension: AI-Based Avatars for Collaborative Education

This repository hosts the implementation of the multiplayer-enhanced version of **GPTAvatar**, a platform for AI-powered virtual avatars designed to facilitate interactive and immersive educational experiences. This project is part of the bachelor's thesis *"Creating Powerful AI-Based Avatars for Education: Developing a Multiplayer for GPTAvatar"*.

## Overview

**GPTAvatar Multiplayer Extension** is an innovative platform that integrates large language models (LLMs), multiplayer capabilities, and customizable 3D avatars to revolutionize collaborative learning in virtual environments. With features like real-time interaction, personalized feedback, and user-driven customization, this project seeks to improve both the immersion and effectiveness of educational tools.

### Key Features
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Collaborative interaction with peers and the AI avatar in real-time.
- **Customizable Avatars**: Integration with [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/) for personalized user representation.
- **3D Classroom Environment**: Navigate, interact, and engage in a fully immersive educational setting.
- **AI-Powered Teacher**: Leverages LLMs (like ChatGPT) to simulate realistic educational interactions, moderate discussions, and provide feedback.
- **Real-Time Voice Chat**: High-quality, low-latency communication between participants using Photon Voice.
- **Dynamic Learning Scenarios**: Support for various educational tasks, such as simulated oral exams or group discussions.

## Technical Details

### Built With
- **Unity**: 3D development platform for creating the virtual environment.

## User Study & Results
As part of this project, a user study was conducted to evaluate the systemâ€™s usability and effectiveness. Participants engaged in simulated oral English exams with the AI avatar acting as a teacher. Results highlighted the potential of GPTAvatar for:
- Improving English language skills.
- Reducing exam anxiety through realistic practice scenarios.
- Facilitating collaborative learning and interaction.

## Future Work
The following areas are proposed for future development:
- Enhanced avatar expressiveness (e.g., non-verbal cues and gestures).
- Integration with VR devices for immersive learning.
- Expansion to support additional subjects and skills.
